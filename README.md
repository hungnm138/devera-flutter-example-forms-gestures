<h1 align="center">Flutter Forms & Gestures Examples</h1>

<p align="center">An example app that demonstrates how to work with forms and gestures in Flutter.</p>

# Getting Started

This example project is used in [Devera](https://devera.vn) Flutter course to demonstrate how to work with forms and gestures in your Flutter app. 

# Introduction

## Build a form with validation

Apps often require users to enter information into a text field. For example, you might require users to log in with an email address and password combination.

To make apps secure and easy to use, check whether the information the user has provided is valid. If the user has correctly filled out the form, process the information. If the user submits incorrect information, display a friendly error message letting them know what went wrong.

In this example, learn how to add validation to a login form that has the text field using the following steps:

1. Create a `Form` with a `GlobalKey`.
2. Add a `TextFormField` with validation logic.
3. Create a button to validate and submit the form.

## Swipe to dismiss

The “swipe to dismiss” pattern is common in many mobile apps. For example, when writing an email app, you might want to allow a user to swipe away email messages to delete them from a list.

Flutter makes this task easy by providing the [Dismissible](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Dismissible-class.html) widget. Learn how to implement swipe to dismiss with the following steps:

1. Create a list of items.
2. Wrap each item in a `Dismissible` widget.
3. Provide “leave behind” indicators.

## Drag and Drop

`Drag and drop` is a common mobile app interaction. As the user presses or long presses (sometimes called *touch* & *hold*) on a widget, another widget appears beneath the user’s finger, and the user drags the widget to a final location and releases it. 

In this example, we’re going to see how easy it is to implement the "drag and drop" functionality in Flutter by creating the skeleton of a simple game. Basically a random number appears at the center of the screen and you have to move it to the left or to the right whether it’s even or odd.
